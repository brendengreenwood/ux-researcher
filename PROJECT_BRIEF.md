# UX Researcher Tool - Project Brief

## Vision

Build a UX research tool that streamlines how researchers conduct, organize, and analyze user interviews. This is the foundation for automating and intelligizing UX research workflows.

## The Bigger Picture

This tool is the primary input source that drives how the entire platform evolves. Research data, insights, and findings from here inform and shape system behavior across the broader intelligence platform. Other systems learn from and adapt to what researchers discover and capture. The output of this tool becomes the directing force for how backend agents, tools, and the orchestrator should behave and evolve.

## Core Purpose

Give researchers a simple, effective way to:

- Organize research projects and define user personas
- Record interviews and capture timestamped insights
- Store everything persistently
- Prepare data for AI-powered analysis and automation

## What We're Building

A functional, useful UX research tool that researchers actually want to use. Not over-engineered, not over-designed. Focused on solving real problems in the research workflow and providing useful exports for other downstream work.

## Key Principles

- **User-focused** - Every feature serves the researcher's actual workflow
- **Simple first** - Build what's needed, avoid premature complexity
- **Extensible** - Data flows cleanly to backend agents and orchestrator
- **Practical** - Solve real pain points in UX research

## Current Focus

Polishing and expanding the core UX researcher interface to create a solid, usable product for conducting and organizing interviews.
